                personal data we have collected from you; an explanation stating
                why we collected it; a list of who, other than us, has had
                access to it; if/how it is being/was used in automated
                decisions, and what processes of ours are/were using it. In
                addition, JotCv will take reasonable steps to permit
                individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is
                demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. You may have access
                to, review, correct, update, change or delete your account
                profile information or profile/resume at any time. Simply log
                into your account, go to your profile/resume, and make the
                necessary changes. You may delete your profile/resume from
                JotCv’s online database at any time by requesting a
                permanent removal of your information from info@jotcv.in.
                Before providing you with a copy of your personal information or
                correcting, updating or deleting such information, we reserve
                the right to verify and authenticate your identity and the
                personal information to which you have requested access. Access
                to or correction, updating or deletion of your personal
                information may be denied or limited by JotCv if it would
                violate another person’s rights and/or as otherwise permitted by
                applicable law. We will respond to information access requests
                within 30 days of receipt, [and we will instruct any
                third-parties with whom we have shared it to erase it.] If we
                require additional time to provide access to your information,
                we will acknowledge receipt of your request within 30 days and
                promptly supplement our response within the time period required
                by applicable law. If you opted to receive newsletters,
                commercial emails or other communications from JotCv or
                third parties at the time you registered with JotCv, but
                subsequently change your mind, you may opt-out by editing your
                Account Profile as described above. If you previously opted not
                to receive such communications, you may later opt-in by editing
                your Account Profile.

            JotCv has implemented technical and organizational measures
              designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss
              and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure.
              Notwithstanding such measures, the Internet is an open system and
              we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be
              able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for
              improper purposes. We will notify the owners of JotCv
              accounts within 48 hours of the discovery of a data breach, and we
              will work with our customers to inform account holders who may
              have been directly affected by the breach.

            <article className="text-justify font-sans py-1">
              Moreover, one of our primary purposes is to provide you with a
              platform to broadcast the information in your profile/resume and
              profile widely and to maximize your career opportunities.
              Accordingly, such an environment does present a risk that
              unauthorized third parties will view this data. Further, your
              profile/resume should not contain any sensitive data including
              personality profiles or data that you would not want made public.

              When you place an order online at JotCv, your credit card
              information is protected through the use of encryption, such as
              the Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol. SSL makes it difficult
              for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while
              being transmitted. JotCv uses a service company to process
              its credit card transactions.
